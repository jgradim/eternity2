** How to use this software ***

On the main board, you can can edit the quads:

Left click: Change the pattern, keep clicking until you find the right
            one. 
            
Middle click: Lock or unlock the quad. A locked quad is used for clue
              pieces for instance. They must be kept at this position
              in the final result.
              Note: When shuffling a grid, locked pieces won't be moved.
              
Mouse wheel: Rotate the piece clockwise or counterclockwise

Arrow keys: While hovering over the quads, use the right and left arrow
            keys on your keyboard to switch through the patterns.			

You can also use the auto-fill method in the menu to create a complete
puzzle with as many patterns as you like, and then use Grid / Shuffle.
